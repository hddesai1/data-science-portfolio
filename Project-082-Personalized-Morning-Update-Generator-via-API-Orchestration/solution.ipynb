Our goal is to create an personalized \"daily update\" message that includes today's weather forecast and the ten most significant news headlines.\n\nWe will gather all the necessary information for our message from NewsAPI and Meteosource, two free online services that offer API access. Then, we'll use a custom prompt with the **OpenAI chat completions API** to generate an engaging message. Finally, we will send this message to the **OpenAI text-to-speech API** to generate an audio file of the message being read aloud and save it to our workspace so we can download and listen to it.",

   "source": "## Before we begin, some preparation\n\nFor this project, we’ll be using several APIs available online. To keep up easily, **we recommend creating accounts on all the sites listed below ahead of time**. We’ll generate API keys during the session, but setting up accounts and confirming emails can take a bit, so it’s best to get that done early.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the OpenAI API isn’t free and needs a credit card to use. Make sure you’ve set up your card by going to \"_settings > billing_” on the [OpenAI platform portal](https://platform.openai.com/) before we start. Otherwise, you might miss out on the most exciting part: generating the digest and having it read out loud! Don’t worry, we won’t be racking up a massive bill with OpenAI, if you want to be safe you can set up a “_Monthly spend limit_” so you won’t end up paying more than you want.\n\nPlease register an account on the following websites:\n- [Meteo source](https://www.meteosource.com/) – Free plan is sufficient\n- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) – Free plan is sufficient\n- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) – Needs a paid plan\n",

   "source": "## A quick refresher on API concepts\n\nBefore we get started let's refresh a few important API concepts. If you've already worked with APIs before, or if you completed my [Introduction to APIs in Python course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-apis-in-python), none of this should be new. For those of you who have never worked with APIs before or have limited experience, this is a useful refresher and will make following along with the rest of the code-along a lot easier.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>What is an API?</summary> \n  <p>\n\nAPIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are like the messengers of the digital world, making sure apps, devices, and services can talk to each other smoothly. They let different systems share data and perform actions without getting tangled in each other’s code. You might not notice it, but APIs are behind almost everything we do digitally. Plug in your electric car, and an API’s handling the data exchange with the charger. Check the weather or get an email on your phone? That’s thanks to APIs pulling and delivering data from online sources to your device.\n\nIn essence, APIs make life easier for both developers and users, setting the rules for how apps communicate and what they can share. Whether it’s streaming music, ordering food, or tracking fitness, APIs keep it all connected. They’re one of the most powerful, behind-the-scenes technologies that make our digital world feel effortless, despite being complex and varied under the hood.\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>REST APIs</summary> \n  <p>\n\nAPIs come in many different styles and flavors, but for the purpose of this code-along, we will be focusing on REST APIs. REST APIs let two systems communicate over the internet, using HTTP, the same protocol your browser uses to load webpages. Think of it like typing a website address into your browser: you send a request, and the page loads in response. \n\nWith rest APIs, the system that sends the request is called **the client**, the system the receives the request and returns a response is usually **the server**. \n\n![Request response cycle](resources/request-response-cycle.png)\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>HTTP Verbs</summary> \n  <p>\n\nREST APIs are based on HTTP verbs. These describe the action the client wishes to perform on a resource on server. In total there are 9 HTTP verbs, in practice you'll be using the 4 most common verbs described in the table below.\n\n| Verb   | Action |\n|-|-|\n| `GET`    | Reading a resource |\n| `POST`   | Create a new resource |\n| `PUT`    | Update an existing resource |\n| `DELETE` | Delete a resource |\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>URLs and parameters</summary> \n  <p>\n\n![Structure of URLs](resources/url-structure.png)\n\nA REST API is accessible over the internet through a URL, which acts like an address that points to a specific resource on the server. This URL includes several parts, as shown in the image: the protocol (http://), the server’s domain (350.5th-ave.com), the port number (like :80), the path to the specific resource (e.g., /unit/243), and optional query parameters (e.g., ?floor=77).\n\nWhen interacting with REST APIs, you’ll often need to include additional information, like filters or specific search terms, to get exactly the data you want. This extra information is usually passed as query parameters in the URL. These parameters help refine your request to retrieve more specific data, making the API flexible and responsive to a wide range of needs.\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Headers</summary> \n  <p>\n\nHeaders carry additional information about the request or response, providing context for how the message should be processed. They can specify how the authenticate or what the content type is that's being sent. Headers essentially help the server and client understand the message’s format and how to handle it. Each header is a key-value pair, written as `Key: Value`, where the key is case-insensitive.\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Response status codes</summary> \n  <p>\n\nThere are over 70 HTTP status codes, grouped into five main categories. These categories help us quickly understand the nature of the response. Codes starting with 1XX are informational, 2XX indicate success, 3XX handle redirections, 4XX signal client-side errors, and 5XX point to server-side issues.\n\nAmong these, three key codes to remember are:\n- `200` **OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the expected data.\n- `404` **Not Found**: The server couldn’t find the requested resource.\n- `500` **Internal Server Error**: Something went wrong on the server’s side, causing the request to fail.\n\n   </p>\n</details>",

Using API key authantication via URL parameters we can securely retrieve the latest headlines and store them in a variable for later use.\n\n## Task 2: Fetching weather data from Meteosource\nNow we can move on to using the meteosource API to get the weather forecast for our location. We'll first need to find the `place_id` for our location before we can fetch the forecast so we'll need to make 2 API requests here in order to get the job done. For meteosource.com we'll also use API-key authentication but this time we'll send the API key via the headers instead of URL parameters.\n\n## Task 3: Using OpenAI completions API to generate the \"morning update\"\nOnce we have retrieved all information from the newapi.org and meteosource.com APIs, we can now use OpenAI completions API (which is the API version of ChatGPT) to generate a nice and engaging \"morning update\" message. The API we'll be using here uses the POST http verb so we'll need to adjust the `requests` functions we are using and also tweak the function arguments.\n\n## Task 4: Generate an MP3 using OpenAI text-to-speech API\nFinally, once we have generated a message, we can now use the text-to-speech API from OpenAI to generate an audio stream using our voice of preference. We'll save the stream locally to an .mp3 file which we can then download and play.",

We should not copy-paste these API-keys directly into our python code because that risks accidentally leaking them when you for example would copy the workbook. Given some of these APIs incur a cost when using them, it's of utmost importance we store them securely.\n\n\n1. Create three environment variables with the following names\n    - `API_KEY_METEOSOURCE`\n    - `API_KEY_NEWSAPI`\n    - `API_KEY_OPENAI`\n2.

Fortunately, meteosource offers an API that allows us to easily search for the `place_id` of any location: `/find_places`.\n\nThe MeteoSource API also requires authentication, this time we'll use the headers to pass on the API key, we'll need to use the `x-api-key` header, so let's first start by creating the dictionary of headers.\n\n➡️ **Instructions:** \n\n- Create a new dictionary named `meteosource_headers` with the correct authentication key and value.",

We just need to put them into Python variables and add the data we received from the NewsAPI and MeteoSource.\n\nOur prompt will consist of two messages. First is the _system message_, it contains instructions for the model, and typically describes what the model is supposed to do and how it should generally behave and respond. \n```text\nYou are an AI assistant tasked with generating a 'Morning Update' text that’s engaging and enjoyable for the user to listen to while having their morning coffee. The update should be about 2-5 minutes long, incorporating both a weather forecast and top 10 news headlines in a way that feels conversational, lively, and fits a specific tone (such as funny, serious, sarcastic, or motivational). Do not output anything else than the text, don't include any markup, lists, or other structural elements. The text will be sent to a text-to-speech API to generate an MP3, so make sure the output contains nothing that should not be read out loud.\n\nStructure the monologue as follows:\n\n1. Greeting: Start with a warm and welcoming greeting.\n2. Weather Summary: Describe the day’s weather, infusing the chosen tone (e.g., funny, serious, etc.) to make it engaging.\n3. News Headlines: Present each headline in the chosen tone, followed by a summary of the headline to give the listener a deeper insight into the headline.\n4. Closing: Wrap up with a concluding remark that leaves the reader with a smile, positive thought, or playful nudge.\n\nBe creative in how you incorporate the tone and style, ensuring that the text is engaging and enjoyable to listen to.\n```\n\nNext is the _user message_, it contains a request with instructions to the model. Think of this as the message you would send to ChatGPT. Note that we've added placeholder for the forecast and headlines data into the message.\n\n```text\nPlease generate a 'Morning Update' text in a funny and light tone.\n\nHere is the Weather Forecast: \n<PLACEHOLDER>\n\nHere are the News Headlines in JSON format:\n<PLACEHOLDER>\n\nGenerate the text as specified in the system prompt, following the structure of greeting, weather summary, 10 headlines, and a closing remark.\n```",

Greeting: Start with a warm and welcoming greeting.\n2. Weather Summary: Describe the day’s weather, infusing the chosen tone (e.g., funny, serious, etc.) to make it engaging.\n3. News Headlines: Present each headline in the chosen tone, followed by a summary of the headline to give the listener a deeper insight into the headline.\n4. Closing: Wrap up with a concluding remark that leaves the reader with a smile, positive thought, or playful nudge.\n\nBe creative in how you incorporate the tone and style, ensuring that the text is engaging and enjoyable to listen to.\n'''\n\n# Create the user_message variable\nuser_message = f'''Please generate a 'Morning Update' text in a funny and light tone.\n\nHere is the Weather Forecast:\n```\n{weather_forecast}\n```\n\nHere are the News Headlines in JSON format:\n```\n{headline_articles}\n```\n\nGenerate the text as specified in the system prompt, following the structure of greeting, weather summary, 10 headlines, and a closing remark.\n'''",

Previously we only had to \"get\" data from the API, but now we are going to be sending data _to_ the API (the prompt) to create a new response. We'll actually be creating something new here, hence we need to use the `POST` verb and corresponding `post()` function of the `requests` library.\n\nThis API also requires authentication, specifically _Bearer authentication_. This means we'll need to add an `authorization` header similar to the MeteoSource API, the only difference is that the value is prefixed with the `Bearer` key-word, followed by the secret token or API key.\n\n**ℹ️ Note:** OpenAI actually offers a really easy to use [Python package called `openai`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#python-library) that makes using the API a lot easier, but for the purpose of learning the underlying concepts of APIs, we'll use the `requests` package and create the API requests ourself.",

Today, we’ve got a classic case of “Is it sunny or cloudy?” Partly sunny with a high of 27 degrees Celsius. So, if you’re feeling adventurous, go ahead and wear those shorts but maybe keep a light jacket handy—because you never know when the clouds will decide to crash the sun’s party this evening. It’s like trying to guess which ice cream flavor the kids will choose—always a gamble!\n\nNow, onto the news! Hold onto your morning pastry because here come the headlines! \n\nIn the world of earthquakes, Istanbul just felt a bit of a shake-up with a 6.2 magnitude quake that had over 150 people scrambling for safety. Thankfully, no serious damage noted—just a reminder of why we should never take a stable coffee table for granted.\n\nMoving on from quakes to politics, longtime Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois has decided to hang up his political boots—at age 80! Looks like he’s opted for a full-time gig at the retirement club. It’s a bold move when most of us are still figuring out how to operate our microwaves at that age!\n\nIn Kashmir, tragedy struck as gunmen attacked tourists, leaving 26 people dead—a heartbreaking reminder that even in paradise, not everything is blissful. Just goes to show we really need to be careful where we take those Instagram selfies.\n\nSad news from the Mediterranean where a swimmer’s remains were discovered after a shark attack off the coast of Israel. Let this be a reminder—maybe today isn’t the best day to dip your toes in a shark-infested sea… or ever, really!\n\nOn a lighter note, in the world of sports, the NFL is buzzing about the upcoming 2025 mock draft! Word has it that the Jaguars are eyeing a wide receiver at number five. Can you imagine the office debates? “I told you, offense wins championships!” \n\nNow, for the students out there, mark your calendars! The government is starting to collect on those defaulted student debts. Yes, it’s that time of year again. So, don’t forget to double-check your finances—who knew adulting could be this much fun?\n\nIn tech, Google is at it again, testing a new layout for the Pixel lock screen. I mean, if it doesn't have a glittery unicorn option, are we even moving forward, folks?\n\nMore exciting science news: NASA’s Lucy spacecraft captured images of an asteroid shaped like an ice cream cone! Honestly, if that’s not a sweet discovery, I don’t know what is. I’m just saying, if they start selling those as actual ice creams… sign me up!\n\nLet’s switch gears to Microsoft, who just unleashed new AI agents to transform your workday. Next thing you know, your computer will be asking, “How may I assist you, human?” We’re heading toward a future where our coffee machines may demand a raise!\n\nFinally, back to the world of finance, the Dow just rallied over 700 points after Trump softened his stance on tariffs. That’s one way to wake up the stock market! Someone might need a coffee just as strong as your morning brew after a rollercoaster like that!\n\nAs we wrap up our morning update, remember: whether it’s a sunny day or the clouds are plotting to bring gloominess, there’s always a reason to smile. So, grab that second cup of coffee, look out at the world, and embrace the crazy beauty of today. Have a fabulous day ahead!\n"
